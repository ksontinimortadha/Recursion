# Recursion

## Description
This program includes two main components: a `isPalindrome` function and the `palindrome` algorithm that utilizes it.

## Usage
You can use the this program to check if a given string is a palindrome by following these steps:

1. Enter a string when prompted.
2. The program will then use the `isPalindrome` function to evaluate the input string (using recursion).
3. It will display whether the input string is a palindrome or not.

### Example
Suppose you enter the string "kayak" as input. The program will display the following output:
